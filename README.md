# Codewars
A website to help programmers improve their skills by training with others on real code challenges.

### Difficulty
8 kyu (easy) â€“ 1 kyu (difficult)

### Repo structure
I've organised my solutions into folders according to difficulty level (e.g. 6 kyu) 
and each file will contain the link to the challenge on the first line as a comment.
